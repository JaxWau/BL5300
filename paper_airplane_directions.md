Here is a step-by-step guide to the creation of the perfect paper airplane. 
Step 1: Obtain one (1) sheet of your favorite paper.
Step 2: Fold your paper of choice in half hot-dog style. Or fold the paper so that when folded the paper is long.
Step 3:Open your folded paper back up to reveal a fold down the middle of the sheet of paper. From here pick a side to be the "front" of the plane. 
Setp 4: Once you have figured out the front of the plane, bring one corner of the paper into the middle to form a triangle. Please note that "middle" is meant by the fold in the paper that goes down the middle, NOT the center of the sheet. Make sure to repeat this step for the other half of the paper.
Step 5: You should now have a sheet of paper that somewhat resembles a house drawing. A trianlge on the top, or front, of the plane and a square on the bottom.
Step 6: Fold the paper in half long ways or "hot-dog style" along the same fold and in the same direction as you did in step 2. 
Step 7: Fold each side of the paper again until there is between 1/2 and 1/4 of the paper between the top of the wing and the bottom of the plane. These will create the wings of the plane. Repeat this step for the other side as well. 
Step 8: Slightly unfold the "wings" so that they are aligned with one another when looking down upon the plane. 
Step 9: Throw the plane, but not too hard or towards anyone to avoid injury, to test the flight of the plane. 
Step 10: Enjoy your new paper plane. Make sure to avoid water and to clean up after yourself when you're done to ensure we don't kill the turles.
